number: "INSY 7120"
title: "Python for Supervised Machine Learning"
credits: 3
modality: face-to-face

description: |
  This course teaches students to apply supervised machine learning methods
  using Python and scikit-learn. Topics include regression, classification,
  decision trees, and ensemble methods. Students develop practical skills
  in the complete ML workflow: data preparation, model fitting, evaluation,
  and selection.

objectives:
  - "Apply the scikit-learn workflow to regression and classification problems"
  - "Interpret model coefficients, metrics, and diagnostics"
  - "Use cross-validation for model selection and hyperparameter tuning"
  - "Implement decision trees and ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost)"
  - "Handle practical challenges: feature engineering, imbalanced data, regularization"
  - "Learn new ML methods independently from documentation"

prerequisites: |
  Graduate standing. INSY 7110 (Python for EDA) is recommended but not required.
  Students without prior Python experience should expect additional study time
  for the prerequisites backfill material.
