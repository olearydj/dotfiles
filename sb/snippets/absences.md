Attendance and class participation is expected. Students remain personally responsible for all in-class material and activities during any absence.

To request extra time or other considerations due to an absence, notify the instructor via email and provide documentation upon request.

Note that *planned* absences (e.g., conference travel, work commitments) should be communicated *in advance* when possible.
