Attendance and class participation is expected. Students remain personally responsible for all in-class material and activities during any absence.

Though not necessary for attendance, excused absences are required to grant any extensions for assignments or tests. They must be approved by Engineering Student Services (ESS), based on the university policies that govern what qualifies as an excused absence. To request extra time or other considerations due to an excused absence:

1. Fill out the online form at [aub.ie/EngAbsence](https://aub.ie/EngAbsence). Include supporting documentation as instructed.
2. Notify us via email that you've submitted the form and the specific considerations you are requesting.
3. ESS will email its decision to both of us within a few days of your request. Assuming it is approved, the plan agreed upon in step two will be honored.

Note that *planned* absences eligible for excuse (e.g. university related trips) must be documented and approved *in advance*.
