Honors College students are encouraged to consider taking the honors section of this course. These classes are combined on Canvas, so all honors related assignments and communications are integrated with the normal class material.

Students enrolled in the honors section must obtain an average of 85% or better in the honors-only assignments and a B or better overall to receive honors credit for the course. Each assignment is relatively short with little to no additional programming required. Instead, they are primarily intended to show how Python and SQL are used to solve problems in the "real world." Honors assignments do not affect your regular course grade. They will be posted to Canvas at approximately evenly-spaced intervals during the semester, with ample lead time and due dates that minimize conflicts with other assignments.
