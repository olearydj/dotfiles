Students who need accommodations are expected to notify the instructor by e-mail during the first week of classes. Accommodation requests received after the second week of class without strong rationale for the delay will be reviewed more critically. In order to establish accommodations through the Office of Accessibility, follow the process outlined here: [Office of Accessibility - Students](https://accessibility.auburn.edu/students/).
