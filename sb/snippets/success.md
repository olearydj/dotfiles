I cannot stress this enough:

*Preparation is the key to success in this class. Studying material before class and asking questions when you do not understand it will significantly improve your chances for success. In addition, you should actually do all of the assignments and additional practice problems. Learning this material takes practice - you have to write, debug, and execute code to be successful in this class. You must invest the time to do so.*
