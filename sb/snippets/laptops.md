Students *must* bring a Mac or Windows laptop to all class meetings. While certain tablets with physical keyboards *may* be sufficient, the class does not support them or other specialty hardware like Chromebooks. You *must* be able to install your own programs on that device. Please ensure that it won't require charging during the class as the number of outlets is limited and the cords create a tripping hazard. If your computer's battery is insufficient, consider investing in a replacement battery or [external power bank](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=laptop+power+bank).
