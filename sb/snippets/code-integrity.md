Zero credit will be given for any submission that attempts to trick the auto-grader by simply reproducing the expected output without solving the problem in an algorithmic manner. Deductions may be assessed for any solution that uses features of the language that have not been taught. All submitted work, unless otherwise stated in the assignment, should represent your personal effort, not that of a human or AI assistant, and you may be asked to demonstrate the ability to reproduce and/or explain any such submission. Failure to do so will result in significant deductions or zero credit for the work. Repeated offenses will result in additional penalties and violations of either policy may also be considered academic dishonesty. This course will use all available means to screen submissions for "similarity" and related issues. Students should not use methods outside the scope of this class without first discussing it with the instructor.
