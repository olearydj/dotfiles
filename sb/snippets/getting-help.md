When requesting support outside of designated office hours, be sure to include:

- The specific code or concept you're struggling with
- Your attempts to solve the problem so far
- The error messages or unexpected results you're encountering
- What you've already tried based on the course materials and documentation
- A subject line that includes the course number and a reference to the specific problem

In the rare case that your question cannot be adequately addressed via email, we are also available by appointment (in-person or Zoom). Requests for in-person support outside of class and designated office-hours will be declined without sufficient evidence of the student's own effort. In any case, the teaching team is here to help you understand and work through specific issues, not to do the work for you.

Remember that stating "I can't do this" without showing your attempts or specific points of confusion will not help us provide effective assistance.

We take your learning outcomes and the student-teaching team relationship very seriously, but this clip cleverly depicts much of the tension between student and instructor goals. As you watch it, consider how Jerry and Cuba both portray a mix of student and instructor concerns. Credit to Dr. Jeff Smith, Emeritus Professor and prior instructor of this course, for first using it in this context.

Technical people take the topic of asking questions very seriously. If you'd like to know more, have a look at Eric Steven Raymond's classic essay, [How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). In an educational setting, where people are literally paid to help you learn, not all of it holds up. But in the real world, where people are paid to do their own work, you would do well to think carefully about when and how to offload your own learning process on others. This article, however psychotic it may seem, has been around 24 years for a reason.
