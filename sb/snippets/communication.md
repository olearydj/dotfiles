In order to ensure your questions / concerns are received and responded to efficiently, all communication outside of class should be conducted via direct email (i.e., from Outlook or other client, not Canvas). Contact via Canvas messages or submission comments is easy to miss and harder to respond to. In most cases we will respond the same day to email received during normal business hours.
