The University is following standard operating procedures at this time, and this class will be administered accordingly. In the unlikely event of circumstances that require emergency operations, all required University policies will be enforced.

If normal class and/or lab activities are disrupted due to illness, emergency, or other crisis, the syllabus and other course plans may be modified to allow completion of the course. If this occurs, an addendum to your syllabus and/or course assignments will replace the original materials.
