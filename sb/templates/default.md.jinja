This course uses the traditional 10-point grading scale (A: 90+, etc.). There will be no unannounced quizzes. Except where specifically directed, all quizzes and tests are closed book, closed notes. Various bonus opportunities may be offered throughout the semester.

Additional details for all assignments can be found on Canvas. The instructor may choose to drop and/or curve grades at their discretion.

### Late and Missed Work

{% if grading.late_policy.type == 'percent_per_day' %}
Late work receives a penalty of up to {{ grading.late_policy.penalty }}% per day.
{% elif grading.late_policy.type == 'not_accepted' %}
Late work is not accepted.
{% endif %}

The approval to make up missed work, including exams, is *not guaranteed*. Students should contact the instructor promptly about any missed work to discuss possible arrangements. Makeup exam requests must be made within 36 hours of the scheduled exam time.

## Getting Help and Communication

We are happy to meet with you during the office hours listed above. Additionally, you are free to email us at any time (details in the following section). Email is often a very effective medium for code-related questions as it allows the teaching team time to carefully review your question and code before responding clearly and concisely, in a format that you can refer back to as required. The exchange is also documented so we all better understand the steps taken.
